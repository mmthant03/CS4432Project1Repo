In order to make sure our new Simple DB is working with new Buffer replacement policy,
we will be testing the created database with a set of SQL queries. 

**Testing:
When you run Examples.java, these queries will be run sequentially.

***1st. Creating Tables

Two tables named Employees and Department tables will be created.
Employee has fields employee ID as "empID", name as "empName" and department ID as "dID".
Department has fields department ID as "deptID", and name as "deptName".

***2nd. Inserting database

Each table will be inserted will dummy data to make sure insertion is working.

***3rd. Querying all fields

Employee table will be run select statement which will select all the employees.
Department table will be run in the same manner.
Resulting data will be shown in the output.

***4rd. Querying a specific record

An employee with ID 1 will be selected from the Employee table and name will be displayed.
A department with ID 100 will be selected from the department table and name will be displayed.

***5th. Querying a specific record from joining tables

The two tables will be joined by department ID key and employees who belong to department ID 100 are selected.
Their names will be displayed.

***6th. Updating record

An employee with ID 3 will be transfer to department ID 102. All employee records are displayed to prove if that 
employee has been transferred or not.

***7th. Deleting record
