# Implementing Efficient Buffer Manager (CS4432 Project1) #

## How to Run: ##

* Unzip the ExtendedSimpleDB and load it into an IDE or other system of your choice. 
* Run Startup.java from src/simpledb.server with a single argument, which names the folder in which database will be created. 
* When a new database server is created, run Examples.java from studentClient/simpledb (default package).
* Examples.java already has a set of basic SQL queries and no need to input.
